Introduce Builder for FeedbackMessages to improve expressiveness and safety

This commit introduces a Builder for FeedbackMessages, which allows users to more easily and clearly express their intentions when creating FeedbackMessages. The Builder provides static methods 'info', 'warn', and 'error' to help guide users through the process of constructing a FeedbackMessage, and allows them to easily add either a message or exception as needed. This should make it easier and safer to use FeedbackMessages in your code.
